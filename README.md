Task 1:- LANDING PAGE
A landing page is an ideal web development project for beginners. It requires basic
knowledge of HTML and CSS. Through this project, you'll learn to create columns, divide
sections, arrange items, and add headers and footers. The most important aspect is
unleashing your creativity to design an impressive page. Pay attention to alignments,
padding, color palette, boxes, and other elements. Be mindful of CSS to avoid overlapping
elements. In short, a landing page project allows you to apply HTML and CSS skills,
encouraging your creativity while ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly design.

Task 3:- CALCULATOR 
To create a basic calculator using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, you'll need to implement an

CSS grid system for button alignments. Use event listeners, if-else statements, operators, and
loops to handle user input and perform calculations. This project requires some skill but can be
done with basic knowledge of these technologies..
